Expressify - Super Cool eCommerce Platform 🚀

Welcome to Expressify, an incredibly awesome eCommerce platform built with Express.js and MongoDB. This project offers a seamless shopping experience, allowing users to explore, search, filter, and sort products with ease. Buckle up for a journey into the world of playful online shopping! 🌐🛒
🚀 Setup

Getting started is a breeze:

    Install dependencies using npm install.
    Set up environment variables (DB connection string, JWT secret, email service credentials) in .env.
    Fire up the application with npm start.

For developers:

    Make your life easier by using nodemon as a dev dependency for automatic server restarts on file changes.

🛠️ Technologies That Make It All Happen

    Express.js: The backbone of our platform.
    Mongoose (MongoDB): For smooth database interactions.
    Multer: Handling those flashy product images.
    JSON Web Token (JWT): Because secure authentication is key.
    Bcrypt: Locking down passwords with some cryptographic magic.
    Express Rate Limit: Keeping the baddies at bay with rate limiting.
    Helmet: Fortifying HTTP headers for added security.
    Compression: Squeezing responses for faster delivery.
    express-validator: Ensuring only the good stuff gets through.
    xss: Shielding against cross-site scripting attacks.
    dotenv: Tidying up with environment variables.
    emailjs || nodemailer: Sending those delightful confirmation emails. 📧

User Profile

    GET /api/profile: Get current user's profile information.
    PUT /api/profile: Update current user's profile.
    DELETE /api/profile: Bid farewell to your profile.

🌟 Product Endpoints - Where Products Shine
Products

    GET /api/products: Get all products.
    GET /api/products/:id: Get a specific product by ID.
    POST /api/products: Create a new product.
    PUT /api/products/:id: Update a product.
    DELETE /api/products/:id: Say goodbye to a product.

Filtering and Sorting

    GET /api/products?category=:category: Filter products by category.
    GET /api/products?sortBy=:field&order=:order: Sort products in style.
    GET /api/products?search=:keyword: Find products with ease.

🦄 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Workflow - Elevating the Experience
Overview

RBAC is a method of restricting system access to authorized users based on their roles within the system. In the context of our eCommerce platform, we can define two primary roles: User and Guest.
Roles

    User: Authenticated users who interact with the platform. They can browse products, make purchases, manage their profiles, and perform other user-specific actions.

    Guest: Non-authenticated users who can browse products and view product details but cannot perform actions that require authentication, such as making purchases or managing profiles.

Workflow for Each Role

User

    Product Browsing:
        View product listings, categories, and details.
        Search, filter, and sort products based on preferences.

    Profile Management:
        View and update their own profile information.
        Change password and update personal details.

Guest

    Product Browsing:
        View product listings, categories, and details.
        Search, filter, and sort products based on preferences.

Workflow Example

    Guest Workflow:
        Guest visits the website and browses product listings.
        Guest views product details and explores different categories.

This RBAC and workflow description outlines the roles and permissions within the platform and provides a clear understanding of the actions each role can perform. 🌐
🚀 Postman Testing - Ensuring Reliability

To ensure the functionality and reliability of the backend, candidates are required to structure their Postman setup effectively. Below are the key components that candidates should include in their Postman testing:
Environment Variables

Utilize environment variables to store sensitive information such as API keys, tokens, and base URLs. This allows for easy management and switching between different environments (e.g., development, production).
Collections

Organize API requests into collections based on functionality or feature sets. Each collection should contain related requests and tests for specific endpoints or scenarios.
Request Structure

Ensure that each request is properly structured with appropriate HTTP methods, headers, query parameters, request body (if applicable), and URL paths. Use descriptive names and comments to provide clarity and context.
Documentation

Document the purpose and usage of each request and test within the collection. Include descriptions, example payloads, and any additional information necessary for understanding and maintaining the tests.
Folder Structure

Organize collections and requests into folders to maintain a logical and hierarchical structure. This helps in managing large collections and makes it easier to navigate and locate specific requests.

By structuring their Postman setup effectively and following best practices, candidates can thoroughly test the backend API and ensure its functionality, reliability, and adherence to specifications. 🧪
